\section{JOB OBJECTIVE}          
    I am a young software developer looking for a job where I can mature as an engineer and learn from experienced developers. In my ideal role I would be complementing my strong theoretical skills with practical industry experience to become a well rounded and effective programmer. I am mostly interested in backend development however it is still early in my career and I am open to whatever opportunities arise.
 
\section{EDUCATION}          
    2009-2013: Bachelor of Software Engineering with First Class Honors at UNSW (Overall WAM 79.508) \\
    2011: UNSW Computer Science Co-op scholarship \\
    2008: HSC at Caringbah Selective High School (91.6 UAI)

    {\bf Software Developer - C++} \>Optiver \>Mar 2014 - present\\
                                   \>Sydney, NSW
   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}      % suppress blank line after tabbing
    Wrote, tested, reviewed, merged and debugged C++ and some Python code for a
    high frequency trading system. This involved writing performance critical
    low latency networking, parsing and calculation code and testing this code
    and others' code using unit tests, automated system tests (setting up mock
    connections, simulating the market, etc), automated regression tests,
    market simulations and replays, manual tests and conformance tests with the
    exchange. I was also involved in the code review process for bug fixes and
    new features, and I fixed many unreproducible bugs which occured in
    production caused by race conditions, invalid memory access, incorrect
    logic, unchecked return codes, and most common of all configuration
    problems such as inappropriate network settings, incorrect config files and
    invalid assumptions such as misunderstandings with the exchange. This work
    was done using Agile methods, such as continuous integration, bug tracking,
    standups, source control (initially subversion with feature branches, then
    moving to git with feature branches and release branches), and code
    reviews, predominantly using Atlassian products to manage this.

    {\bf Programmer - Haskell, C, C++} \>UNSW \>Sep 2013 - Mar 2014\\
                                       \>Kensington, NSW
   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}      % suppress blank line after tabbing
    Made many major bug fixes and improvements to research software, including
    fixing various logic errors, inconsistencies and race conditions in a C++
    GUI program, fixing undefined behavior in a Haskell model checking program,
    incorporating version control for both of these programs (specifically
    git), and adding various tests (unit, black box, manual etc). I also
    participated in discussions relating to further research and innovation and
    helped implement the associated new algorithms (eg binary decision trees,
    bounded model checking) and formalisms (mu calculus, buchi automata,
    incorporating probability etc).

   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}      % suppress blank line after tabbing
    Worked on research articles for recommender systems. This included text
    feature extraction, gathering and analyzing statistics from an Oracle
    database, reporting on findings and documentation.

    Teaching and demonstrating first year programming to engineering students,
    with a particular focus on MS Excel and VBA macro programming. Duties
    included lab setup and marking.

   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}
    Software development, source control, documentation and debugging,
    using technologies such as Delphi (Pascal), subversion, python, perl and
    build systems, among others. Fixed various GUI bugs, race conditions, and
    runtime errors, implemented new features, optimized sql queries, logic
    functions and gui interactions, and documented various libraries used
    throughout the point of sales software being developed.

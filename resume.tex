    Worked on various high frequency trading programs, including a few market
    links, a panic button, an autotrader, an exchange simulator (for testing),
    and various other scripts to automate testing. These tasks entailed,
    amongst other things, reverse engineering, low level network programming,
    testing (unit, system, integration, conformance, manual) of not only my
    code but other developers changes which I also merged and reviewed (and
    assumed the associated risk and quality requirements).

    {\bf Programmer - Haskell, C, C++} \>UNSW \>2013-2014\\
                     \>Kensington, NSW
   \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}      % suppress blank line after tabbing
    Made many major bug fixes and improvements to research software, including
    fixing various logic errors, inconsistencies and race conditions in a C++
    GUI program, fixing undefined behavior in a Haskell model checking program,
    incorporating version control for both of these programs (specifically
    git), and adding various tests (unit, black box, manual etc). I also
    participated in discussions relating to further research and innovation and
    helped implement the associated new algorithms (eg binary decision trees,
    bounded model checking) and formalisms (mu calculus, buchi automata,
    incorporating probability etc).

    Worked on research articles for recommender systems. This included text
    feature extraction, gathering and analyzing statistics from an Oracle
    database, reporting on findings and documentation.

    Software development, source control, documentation and debugging,
    using technologies such as Delphi (Pascal), subversion, python, perl and
    build systems, among others. Fixed various GUI bugs, race conditions, and
    runtime errors, implemented new features, optimized sql queries, logic
    functions and gui interactions, and documented various libraries used
    throughout the point of sales software being developed.


\section{COMPUTER SKILLS}          
    Extensive knowledge of MS Office (Excel, Access, VBA, Word), Unix (sh, perl, git, ssh, unix commands, config files), Microprocessors (ARM, Arduino, AVR, LEGO Mindstorms), robots (ROS toolchain) \\
